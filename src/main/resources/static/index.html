        <p>It is the year 2040 the number of cars on the road has reached almost unsustainable levels.<br/>
            The government establishes a new Traffic Officer department, and you are members of the advanced R&D division.</p>
        <p>Our division is researching the use of drone beacons with Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR).<br/>
            The drones can rest on platforms along roads and motorways and can be relocated in a matter of minutes.</p>
        <h2>Your tasks</h2>
        <h3>Coding challenge</h3>
        <p>Develop an API that calculates the average car speed in a particular area.<br/>
            If the average speed falls below 10mph, a congestion alert is raised.</p>
        <p>Some cars will not get past the second ANPR collector, ensure that does not impact the average speed calculation or introduce memory leaks.</p>
        <h3>Operations/Networking challenge</h3>
        <p>Develop a Dockerimage for your application. Build, deploy to docker hub so that it runs on the pi cluster.</p>
        <h2>Stretch goal</h2>
        <p>If the mobile beacon is re-located, the distance between the ANPR systems changes,
            recalculate the distance and calculate the average speed appropriately from then on.</p>
        <h3>Hints</h3>
        <p>Speed is calculated as distance/time. Distance could be miles/km/m;</p>
        <p>Your software will be deployed in a cluster, decide early your state strategy (Stateless, stateful services);</p>
        <p>(If applicable) Decide which part of the software delivery life cycle is going to be responsible for code compilation;</p>
        <p>Raspberry pis have a specific architecture. It might influence compilation strategy.</p>
